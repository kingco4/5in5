    <h1>Does Heaven have a ghetto?</h1>
        <p>Personaly I am not sure how to answer this question, but I guess we can start out by defining what heaven is 
        and what a ghetto is.</p>
        <br>
        <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Heaven</th>
            <th>Ghetto</th>
            </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>a place regarded in various religions as the abode of god and the angels, and of the good after death, often traditionally depicted as being above the sky.</td>
            <td>A part of a cirt especially a slum area, occupied by a minority group or groups.</td>
         </tr>
        
        </table>
        <br>
        <h2>With that knowledge is there really a ghetto in heaven?</h2>
            <div class="myAnswer">
            <p>Considering that heaven is not regarded as a city and ghettos are usually areas in a city, I would say no heaven does not have a ghetto.</p>
